_Version 1.1_

This guide explains how to get a Golden Visa (GV) for people who are already residents of the UAE (any emirate). It explains the various stages, what information to submit, and how to sponsor your family.

### Update history
1.1 - Corrected pricing for stage 4, added summary table.
1.0 - Initial release

### Not already a UAE resident?
This guide contains useful elements, but it's not specifically designed for your needs.

### Terminology

In this document, the acronyms FAIC, ICA, and UAEICP will be used interchangably to refer to the _Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security_.
|Terminology|Description|
|-|-|
|Attested degree|A degree of the rank Bachelor or above that has received 3 stamps (your government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs equivalent, your country's UAE embassy, and the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|
|ADRO|Abu Dhabi Residents Office|
|EID|Emirates ID|
|FAIC|Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security.|
|GV|Golden Visa|
|ICP|Another name for FAIC.|
|PRO|Public Relations Officer. PROs are private sector government liaison and can make your life easier. PROs know the processes back to front, and know who to call when things aren't clear. They are highly recommended but charge a fee.|
|UAEICP|Another name for the FAIC.|

### What's the total cost?

For 1 person, the government fees are:
| Fees Description | Amount (AED) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| **Stage 1.** Get GV nomination     | Free       |
| **Stage 2.** Apply for GV |AED 356.20 |
| **Stage 3.** Change status | AED 660.29 |
| **Stage 4.** Issue residence | AED 1,268.48 |
| **Stage 4.** Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa ("medical test") | AED 360.00 |
| **Stage 5.** Residency and Identity Issuance | AED 1,115.02 |
| **Total** | AED 3,759.99|

For each person you sponsor, the government fees are the **same amount**.
| Fees Description | Amount (AED) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| **Stage 6A.** Sponsor dependent | AED 356.20 |
| **Stage 6B.** Change status of dependent | AED 660.29 |
| **Stage 6C.** Change residency of dependent | AED 1268.48 |
| **Stage 6C.** Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa ("medical test") | AED 360.00 |
| **Stage 6D.** Residency and Identity Issuance of dependent | AED 1,115.02 |
| **Total** | AED 3,759.99|

So for a family, the total charge is:
| Family type | Amount (AED) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| **You** | AED 3,759.99 |
| **You + 1 dependent**	| AED 7,519.98 |
| **You + 2 dependents** | AED 11,279.97 |
| **You + 3 dependents** | AED 15,039.96 |

| **You + 8 dependents** | AED 33,839.91 |
| **You + 9 dependents** | AED 37,599.90 |
| **You + 10 dependents** | AED 41,359.89 |

* Fees are subject to change.
* If the dependent is below 18, a medical is not required.
* If you choose urgent fees for the medical test, the cost will be higher.
* Excludes cost of PRO.

# Process

The statement _"I want a golden visa"_ is vague. It is actually 6 separate milestones as follows:
1. [**Get GV nomination.**](#stage-1-get-gv-nomination) You need to meet the criteria for a GV.
2. [**Apply for GV.**](#stage-2-apply-for-gv) You get the GV for yourself, and cancel your family visas to prepare for their golden visas. You are NOT a Resident yet.
3. [**Change status.**](#stage-3-change-status) You have received the visa in the previous step, but need to perform the logical equivalent of re-entering the country under your new GV. You can achieve this by flying out of the UAE and returning, or simply paying for a _Change Status_ procedure _(highly recommended)_.
4. [**Issue residence.**](#stage-4-issue-residence) Now that you have entered the UAE with your GV, you need to change your status to Resident.
5. [**Residency and Identity Issuance.**](#stage-5-residency-and-identity-issuance) Now that you're a resident, you need to apply for a new EID.
6. [**Applying for GV for your family.**](#stage-6-applying-for-gv-for-your-family) _(If applicable)_. Now that you've got a Golden Visa, you may apply for your family.

This is illustrated as follows.

If you perform the process perfectly, steps 2-5 will look like this in the ICA portal (reverse order, note the date and time).
![Process](./images/0-summary-process.png)

## Stage 1: Get GV nomination
You need a GV nomination. There are multiple nominating authorities including:

* [Abu Dhabi Residents Office (ADRO)](https://www.adro.gov.ae/Visas/Types-of-Visas/Abu-Dhabi-Golden-Visa). If you are an Abu Dhabi resident who earns more than AED 30,000, this is likely your best route. The ADRO website has the [formal criteria required](https://www.adro.gov.ae/Visas/Types-of-Visas/Abu-Dhabi-Golden-Visa/Specialists) to be eligible for a nomination.
* [UAE Ministry of Culture & Youth](https://mcy.gov.ae/en/goldenvisa/)
* [Emirates Council of Scientists](https://science.gov.ae/)
* and many more

Each organisation has its own nomination criteria, so select the organisation with criteria that suits your circumstance. Consult the u.ae website for a [list of nominating authorities](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa). For specific details, you will have to visit the website of the individual nominating authority.

### What is a nomination?
This is an recommendation made directly by the nominating authority confirming that you are eligible. For ADRO nominations, they will create a record directly in the FAIC system: there is no physical letter or PDF to collect. This may differ with other nominating authorities.

### How do I get a nomination through the ADRO?

Applying through the ADRO can be done through the [TAMM](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/aspects-of-life/visaemiratesid/entryresidencypermits/VisaRequirements/RequestforGoldenVisaNomination) web portal.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an Abu Dhabi resident to receive an ADRO nomination, but it is not actually necessary to live in Abu Dhabi. You can live in Dubai or another emirate, so long as your existing visa was issued by Abu Dhabi.

When you have applied, you will receive a confirmation email.

![ADRO GV nomination requested](./images/tamm-submission.png)

ADRO will typically take 2-3 days to review your application. If successful, you will receive an approval email.

![ADRO GV nomination approval](./images/tamm-approved.png)

ADRO will nominate you to FAIC, and you will receive an automated email from ICA as follows.

![Confirmation of nomination from FAIC](./images/ica-email-1.png)

Once you have this automated email, you may proceed to the next stage.

## Stage 2: Apply for GV
Once you have a GV nomination, you can proceed to apply (and hopefully receive!) a GV. This is the most complex stage where people get stuck. You can start this process by engaging a PRO, or submitting an application yourself through the ICA Smart Services web portal.

### Who can do this?
PRO or you (through ICA website).

### Process
You need to go to the ICA website and submit a request of type `VISA - GOLDEN RESIDENCE - PERSONS WHO ARE TALENTED PIONEERS - ISSUE NEW VISA` after which ICA will analyse your request. If everything is ok with your submission, it will reach _Awaiting Visa/Residency Cancellation_. If not, you request will go in a loop of _Returned for modification_ -> _Re-submitted_ until it is correct or it has been returned 3 times (_Rejected_). If it has been rejected, you must pay the AED 354.57 application fee again to restart stage 2. It is not uncommon for an application to be rejected, so do not panic if this occurs. It does not count against you.

![How to download eVisa](./images/3-download-evisa.png)

![Sample Entry Permit](./images/3-entry-permit.jpg)

### Cost
These are the fees charged by ICA, and do not include any translation or attestation charges.

| Fees Description | Amount (AED) | VAT Amount (AED) 5% | Total with VAT |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- |
| REQUEST FEES     | 100.00       | 0.00                |                |

| ICP FEES | 122.00 | 0.00 ||
| ELECTRONIC PAYMENT FEES | 4.57 | 0.23 ||
| Total ||| 356.20 AED |

## Stage 3: Change status
In the previous stage, your visa was cancelled. At this point, you do not have an active visa and you are currently within the _grace period_. You need to perform the _logical equivalent_ of exiting the UAE and re-enter using an _Entry Permit (EP)_. You can achieve this by flying out of the UAE and returning, or simply performing the _Change Status_ procedure, formally known as `RESIDENCY - ALL RESIDENCE TYPES - CHANGE STATUS - CHANGE STATUS`. When this stage is completed successfully, you will have _"re-entered"_ the country using an _Entry Permit (EP)_.

### Who can do this?
PRO or you (through ICA website).

### Process stages
There are only 2 stages: _Submitted_ and _Approved_. Here is a screenshot of a successful submission. 
![Flow for stage 3](./images/3-flow.png)

| Fees Description | Amount (AED) | VAT Amount (AED) 5% | Total with VAT |

| E-SERVICE FEES | 28.00 | 1.40 ||
| ICP FEES | 122.00 | 0.00 ||
| ELECTRONIC PAYMENT FEES | 8.47 | 0.42 ||
| Total ||| 660.29 AED |

## Stage 4: Issue Residence
You are now in the country using a temporary _Entry Permit (EP)_. The EP is a visa with 60 days validity which gives you enough time to finalise your residency status which includes a medical test. Once you've completed the medical test, you can begin the residency issue process which is formally known as `RESIDENCY - Golden Residence - PERSONS WHO ARE TALENTED PIONEERS - ISSUE RESIDENCE`. At the successful completion of this stage, you will receive your GV with 10 years validity!

### How do I book a medical test?
This needs to be performed through [Emirates Health Service (EHS)](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/) using their [Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/examination-of-medical-fitness-for-residency-visa) process. It's important you use EHS because they will upload the results of your medical test directly to ICA.

Go to the [Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/examination-of-medical-fitness-for-residency-visa) page on the EHS website then click **Start Service**. Sign in with your UAE Pass.

![EHS webpage](./images/4-ehs.png)

Once signed in, change to English.

![EHS webpage in Arabic](./images/4-frontpage-arabic.png)

Under _Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa_, click **Apply Now**.

![EHS webpage in English](./images/4-frontpage-english.png)

Fill out the booking details. In the section _Eida Number_, enter your **Emirates ID number**. Under _Permit Residence Number_, enter your **Entry Permit No** from your eVisa.

![EHS booking stage 1](./images/4-booking-1.png)

For your Unified Number, enter the _U.I.D._ No from your _Entry Permit_ PDF. For your Arabic name, copy and paste this from your _Entry Permit_ PDF.

![EHS booking stage 1](./images/4-booking-2.png)

As you are applying for a GV, your sponsor is yourself. If you are applying for your dependent, put your name in this field.

![EHS booking stage 1](./images/4-booking-3.png)

### If I'm pregnant, do I still need to perform the x-ray part of the medical test?
No. They will perform a blood test to confirm you are pregnant.

### Do I need to upload the results of the medical certificate anywhere?
No, this is done automatically.

## Stage 5: Residency and Identity Issuance

The formal name of this process is `RESIDENCY - Golden Residence - PERSONS WHO ARE TALENTED PIONEERS - RESIDENCY AND IDENTITY ISSUANCE`. Once you've submitted the form, you'll get a _REGISTRATION ID CARD FORM_ that looks something like this.

![REGISTRATION ID CARD FORM](./images/5-eid-form.png)

If you want to check status of the EID, enter the _Application No_ into the [status check website](https://icp.gov.ae/en/services/priority-services/id-card-status/). The card can take up to 2-3 weeks to be ready. When it's ready, pick it up at Emirates Post.
