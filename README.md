# Guide to getting the UAE Golden Visa (for residents)
This guide explains how to get a Golden Visa (GV) for people who are already residents of the UAE (any emirate). It explains the various stages, what information to submit, and how to sponsor your family.

### Not already a UAE resident?
Some parts of this guide may be helpful but this guide is not intended for you.

### Terminology

In this document, the acronyms FAIC, ICA, and UAEICP will be used interchangably to refer to the _Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security_.
|Terminology|Description|
|-|-|
|Attested degree|A degree of the rank Bachelor or above that has received 3 stamps.|
|ADRO|Abu Dhabi Residents Office|
|EID|Emirates ID|
|FAIC|Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security.|
|GV|Golden Visa|
|ICP|Another name for FAIC.|
|PRO|Public Relations Officer. PROs are private sector government liaison and can make your life easier. PROs know the processes back to front, and know who to call when things aren't clear. They are highly recommended but charge a fee.|
|UAEICP|Another name for the FAIC.|


# Process

The statement _"I want a golden visa"_ is vague. It is actually 6 separate milestones as follows:
1. [**Get GV nomination.**](#stage-1-get-gv-nomination) You need to meet the criteria for a GV.
2. [**Apply for GV.**](#stage-2-apply-for-gv) You get the GV for yourself, and cancel your family visas to prepare for their golden visas. You are NOT a Resident yet.
3. [**Change status.**](#stage-3-change-status) You have received the visa in the previous step, but need to perform the logical equivalent of re-entering the country under your new GV. You can achieve this by flying out of the UAE and returning, or simply paying for a _Change Status_ procedure _(highly recommended)_.
4. [**Issue residence.**](#stage-4-issue-residence) Now that you have entered the UAE with your GV, you need to change your status to Resident.
5. [**Residency and Identity Issuance.**](#stage-5-residency-and-identity-issuance) Now that you're a resident, you need to apply for a new EID.
6. [**Applying for GV for your family.**](#stage-6-applying-for-gv-for-your-family) _(If applicable)_. Now that you've got a Golden Visa, you may apply for your family.

This is illustrated as follows.

This document describes how to perform these tasks.

## Stage 1: Get GV nomination
You need a GV nomination. There are multiple nominating authorities including:

* [Abu Dhabi Residents Office (ADRO)](https://www.adro.gov.ae/Visas/Types-of-Visas/Abu-Dhabi-Golden-Visa). If you are an Abu Dhabi resident who earns more than AED 30,000, this is likely your best route. The ADRO website has the [formal criteria required](https://www.adro.gov.ae/Visas/Types-of-Visas/Abu-Dhabi-Golden-Visa/Specialists) to be eligible for a nomination.
* [UAE Ministry of Culture & Youth](https://mcy.gov.ae/en/goldenvisa/)
* [Emirates Council of Scientists](https://science.gov.ae/)
* and many more

Each organisation has its own nomination criteria, so select the organisation with criteria that suits your circumstance. Consult the u.ae website for a [list of nominating authorities](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa). For specific details, you will have to visit the website of the individual nominating authority.

### What is a nomination?
This is an recommendation made directly by the nominating authority confirming that you are eligible. For ADRO nominations, they will create a record directly in the FAIC system: there is no physical letter or PDF to collect. This may differ with other nominating authorities.

### How do I get a nomination through the ADRO?

Applying through the ADRO can be done through the [TAMM](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/aspects-of-life/visaemiratesid/entryresidencypermits/VisaRequirements/RequestforGoldenVisaNomination) web portal.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an Abu Dhabi resident to receive an ADRO nomination, but it is not actually necessary to live in Abu Dhabi. You can live in Dubai or another emirate, so long as your existing visa was issued by Abu Dhabi.

When you have applied, you will receive a confirmation email.

![ADRO GV nomination requested](./images/tamm-submission.png)

ADRO will typically take 2-3 days to review your application. If successful, you will receive an approval email.

![ADRO GV nomination approval](./images/tamm-approved.png)

ADRO will nominate you to FAIC, and you will receive an automated email from ICA as follows.

![Confirmation of nomination from FAIC](./images/ica-email-1.png)

Once you have this automated email, you may proceed to the next stage.

## Stage 2: Apply for GV
Once you have a GV nomination, you can proceed to apply (and hopefully receive!) a GV. This is the most complex stage where people get stuck. You can start this process by engaging a PRO, or submitting an application yourself through the ICA Smart Services web portal.

### Formal ICA process name
`VISA - GOLDEN RESIDENCE - PERSONS WHO ARE TALENTED PIONEERS - ISSUE NEW VISA`.

### Who can do this?
PRO or you.

### Process
Once you have uploaded the correct documentation, ICA will analyse your request. If everything is ok with your submission, it will reach _Awaiting Visa/Residency Cancellation_. If not, you request will go in a loop of _Returned for modification_ -> _Re-submitted_ until it is correct or it has been returned 3 times (_Rejected_). If it has been rejected, you must pay the AED 354.57 application fee again to restart stage 2. It is not uncommon for an application to be rejected, so do not panic if this occurs. It does not count against you.

### Government fees

| Fees Description | Amount (AED) | VAT Amount (AED) 5% | Total with VAT |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- |
| REQUEST FEES     | 100.00       | 0.00                |                |

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended that you translate your university degree and salary certificate into Arabic. Both are criteria for Golden Visa, and rejection will cost you time and effort.

## Stage 3: Change status
In the previous stage, your visa was cancelled. At this point, you do not have an active visa and you are currently in the _grace period_. You need to perform the _logical equivalent_ of exiting the UAE and re-entering using an _Entry Permit (EP)_. You can achieve this by flying out of the UAE and returning, or simply paying for a _Change Status_ procedure _(highly recommended)_. When this stage is complete, you will have _"re-entered"_ the country using an _Entry Permit (EP)_.

### Formal ICA process name
`RESIDENCY - ALL RESIDENCE TYPES - CHANGE STATUS - CHANGE STATUS`.

### Who can do this?
PRO or you (through ICA website).

### Input
Stage 2 needs to complete.

### Output
You will receive an _Entry Permit_ PDF file.

### Cost
| Fees Description | Amount (AED) | VAT Amount (AED) 5% | Total with VAT |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- |
| REQUEST FEES    | 500.00       | 0.00                |                |
| E-SERVICE FEES | 28.00 | 1.40 ||
| ICP FEES | 122.00 | 0.00 ||
| ELECTRONIC PAYMENT FEES | 8.47 | 0.42 ||
| Total ||| 658.47 AED |

## Stage 4: Issue Residence
You are now in the country using a temporary _Entry Permit (EP)_. The EP is a visa with 60 days validity which gives you enough time to finalise your residency status which includes a medical test (bloodwork and x-ray). If you believe you are pregnant, the x-ray can be swapped for a pregnancy test.

### How do I book a medical test?
This needs to be performed through [Emirates Health Service (EHS)](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/) using their [Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/examination-of-medical-fitness-for-residency-visa) process. It's important you use EHS because they will upload the results of your medical test directly to ICA.

Go to the [Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/examination-of-medical-fitness-for-residency-visa) page on the EHS website then click **Start Service**. Sign in with your UAE Pass.

![EHS webpage](./images/4-ehs.png)

Once signed in, change to English.

![EHS webpage in Arabic](./images/4-frontpage-arabic.png)

Under _Examination of Medical Fitness for Residency Visa_, click **Apply Now**.

![EHS webpage in English])(./images/4-frontpage-english.png)

Fill out the booking details. In the section _Eida Number_, enter your **Emirates ID number**. Under _Permit Residence Number_, enter your **Entry Permit No** from your eVisa.
