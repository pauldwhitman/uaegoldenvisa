## Part 1: Get GV nomination
You need a GV nomination letter. There are multiple organisations that are authorised to give a GV nomination including

* [Abu Dhabi Residents Office (ADRO)](https://www.adro.gov.ae/Visas/Types-of-Visas/Abu-Dhabi-Golden-Visa). If you are an Abu Dhabi resident who earns more than AED 30,000, this is likely your best route.
* [UAE Ministry of Culture & Youth](https://mcy.gov.ae/en/goldenvisa/)
* [Emirates Council of Scientists](https://science.gov.ae/)
* and many more

Each organisation has its own nomination criteria, so select the organisation with criteria that suits your circumstance.

### ADRO Process

Applying through the ADRO can be done through the [TAMM](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/aspects-of-life/visaemiratesid/entryresidencypermits/VisaRequirements/RequestforGoldenVisaNomination) web portal.

When you have applied, you will receive a confirmation email.
